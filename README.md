# MuscleHub-AB-Test
A Codecademy Project

MuscleHub is a fictional gym. In this project, two groups of visitors were assigned a group. We are under the assumption that visitors are more likely to purchase a membership to the gym if they don't have to take the currently required fitness test. Group A is the control group, Group B is our experimental group.

All code for this project was done in Python. Normally the file used for analysis would be put together using SQL, Codecademy provided a plugin for Python that allows for SQL style code to be used inside of a python fuction instead of having to use two separate programs for this project.
